# Fabrication-of-CMOS

WE'LL LOOK AT THE ADVANTAGES OF A HAFNIUM OXIDE BASED CMOS DEVICE AND IT'S ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES.


A CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) device is an electronic component that uses both p-type and n-type MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) to perform logic operations or signal processing. CMOS technology is widely used in microprocessors, memory chips, sensors, and digital circuits due to its low power consumption, high noise immunity, and fast switching speeds.

*Key Features of CMOS Devices:
  Low Power Consumption – Uses almost no power in a static state since only small amounts of current flow during switching.
  High Speed – Operates at high frequencies, making it ideal for modern computing.
  High Noise Immunity – Less susceptible to electrical noise compared to other logic families.
  Compact Size – Can integrate millions to billions of transistors in a small area (e.g., in microprocessors).
  Wide Voltage Range – Typically operates at voltages ranging from 1V to 5V.
*Examples of CMOS Devices:
  Microprocessors (CPUs)
  Memory Chips (RAM, Flash Memory)
  Image Sensors (CMOS Sensors in Cameras)
  Logic Gates and ICs
  Analog and Digital Circuits
